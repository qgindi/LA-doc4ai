# Code editor - Error info

Errors are detected in editor, as well as when compiling the code. Code parts with errors have red squiggly underlines, warnings green. A tooltip shows error/warning description. Also can contain links to fix the error, for example add a missing `using namespace` or Windows API declaration.
