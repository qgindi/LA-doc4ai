# Code editor - Go to script, file, URL

Click a file path string and press `F12` to select it in File Explorer. In the same way you can open folders, script files and web pages. It also works in meta comments, other comments and in code like `folders.System + @"notepad.exe"`. If the path etc does not start and end with `"`, at first select it.
