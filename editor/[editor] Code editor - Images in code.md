# Code editor - Images in code

If a code line contains a string or comment with a file path, embedded image (screenshot, `"image:"`) or `"*icon"`, editor draws the image at the left. Also captures screenshots when recording etc. Embedded image data usually is hidden.

This feature can be enabled/disabled with the toolbar button.
