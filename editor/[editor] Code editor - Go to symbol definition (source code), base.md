# Code editor - Go to symbol definition (source code), base

Click a symbol and press `F12`. Or click the **source code** link in the autocompletion item info or parameter info window.

If the symbol is defined in your code, it opens that file and moves the text cursor. Else it can help to find the source code online.

The **Go to base** command finds the base class or implemented/overriden method definition.
