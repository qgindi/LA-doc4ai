# Code editor - Bookmarks

You can mark lines in code, and later go there. Use menu **Edit > Navigate**, panel **Bookmarks** and the markers margin.

Menu commands **Previous bookmark** and **Next bookmark** visit only active bookmarks. If there are no active bookmarks - only bookmarks in current document.
