# File properties - `pr` (button **Project**)

Add a reference to a class library created in this workspace. Meta comment `/*/ pr File.cs; /*/`.

The compiler will compile it if need and use the created dll file as a reference.

To remove this meta comment, edit the code. Optionally delete unused dll files.
