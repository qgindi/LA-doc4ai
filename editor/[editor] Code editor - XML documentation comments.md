# Code editor - XML documentation comments

Editor gets data for quick info, parameter info and other info about symbols from their assemblies and XML documentation comments. You can write XML documentation comments for your functions and types; look for how to on the internet. Documentation of the automation library and .NET is installed with the program. Documentation of other assemblies comes from their `assembly.dll` + `assembly.xml` files.

Editor also helps to write XML documentation comments. Adds empty summary and parameters when you type `///` above a class, method etc. Adds `///` on `Enter`, shows a list of tags, autocompletes tags, color-highlights tags, text and `see` references.
