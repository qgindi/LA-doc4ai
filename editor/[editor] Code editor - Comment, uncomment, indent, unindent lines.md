# Code editor - Comment/uncomment/indent/unindent lines

To disable or enable a line of code by converting it to/from comments, you can use the toolbar button or **Edit** menu or right-click the selection margin. If multiple lines are selected, it converts all. If not full line(s) selected, the button uses a `/*block comment*/`.

Press `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` to indent or unindent all selected lines. It adds or removes one tab character before each line.
