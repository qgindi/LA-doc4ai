# Code editor - Text folding

You can hide and show code regions like in a tree view control: click the **[-]** or **[+]** in the left margin. Folding is available for functions, events, types, multiline comments, disabled code (`#if`), `#region` ... `#endregion`, `//.` ... `//..`, namespaces, local functions, lambda, initializer lists and strings.

`Ctrl`+click to show/hide descendant folds as well. `Shift`+click to show descendants. For more options right-click the folding margin.
