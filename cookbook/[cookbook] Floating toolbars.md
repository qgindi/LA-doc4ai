# Floating toolbars

You can create custom toolbars, and attach them to windows or screen edges. Toolbar buttons can execute any code, for example run scripts and programs.

To create initial toolbar code easily, use menu **TT > New toolbar**.

Quick ways to add a toolbar button:

- Clone an existing button.
- Snippet: start typing `tool` and select `tbToolbarButtonSnippet`.
- Drag and drop a script, file, folder or link. Then select menu item **t[name] = ...**.
- Use the quick capturing hotkey (default `Ctrl+Shift+Q`) to add a "run program" button.

To set button icon: click the button in the code editor, and double-click an icon in the **Icons** dialog.

Click the **Run** button to apply changes after editing. To show a window-attached toolbar, open or activate its trigger window. The toolbar initially is in its top-left corner. `Shift`+drag to move it to another place relative to the window. Toolbar properties can be changed in code and in the right-click menu.

To delete a toolbar:

- If it's in a separate file, you can delete the file.
- Else delete its function and trigger.
- To disable temporarily, just comment out the trigger.

To see a list of currently running toolbars and find lost toolbars, use menu **TT > Active toolbars**. It shows toolbar rectangles. Right-click to show a context menu.
