# Introduction, finding info

With this [program](/editor/Program.html) you can create, manage and run automation [scripts](/editor/Scripts.html).

Where to find info, code examples and classes/functions:

- This cookbook is a collection of code examples and info.
- Press `Ctrl+Space` in the [code editor](/editor/Code%20editor.html) and select from the list.
- [Automation library reference](/api/index.html) (menu **Help > Library help**).

If need something more, try:

- [Forum](https://www.libreautomate.com/forum/) (menu **Help > Forum**).
- Internet: [stackoverflow](https://www.google.com/search?q=stackoverflow), [Microsoft technical documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=Microsoft+technical+documentation), etc.
- Programming libraries: [NuGet](dot-NET%2C%20NuGet%2C%20other%20libraries.html), [GitHub](https://www.google.com/search?q=GitHub), etc.
- [Windows API](Windows%20API%2C%20native%20libraries.html).

Simple automations can be recorded. The input recorder records keys and mouse clicks in any window. You can edit the recorded code: insert [wait](Simple%20wait%20%28sleep%2C%20delay%29.html), edit [window names](Find%20window%2C%20controls%2C%20activate.html), etc.

This cookbook contains recipes for many commonly used automations. You can ask to add more recipes: use forum or email (menu **Help**).
