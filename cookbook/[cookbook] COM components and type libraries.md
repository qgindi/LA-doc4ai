# COM components and type libraries

COM component API often are declared in type libraries. In C# they can't be used directly, but the editor can convert a type library to a .NET assembly, and scripts can use the assembly instead. To convert, in the **Properties** dialog click **COM** or **...** and select a type library.

Assume you want to use the shell type library in current script.

- Open the **Properties** dialog.
- In the **Find in lists** field type `shell` (optionally, just to make the list smaller).
- Click the **COM** button. In the list select **Microsoft Shell Controls and Automation**. It converts the COM type library to a .NET assembly.
- Click **OK**. It adds a comment line like `/*/ com Shell32 ...; /*/` in the script.
- Below that line press `Ctrl+Space` and you'll see namespace `Shell32` added to the list. Use it like any other namespace.

```
/*/ com Shell32 1.0 #aab51e65.dll; /*/
using Shell32;

var shell = new Shell32.Shell();
shell.FileRun();
foreach (FolderItem v in shell.NameSpace(@"C:\").Items()) {
	print.it(v.Path);
}
```

Notes:

- To create objects, use interfaces (like `Shell` in the above example). Not classes like `ShellClass`.
- When converting a COM type library, may print several warnings "can't convert...". Ignore them.
- When converting, may create several assembles. The **OK** button adds them all to the script. One of them is the main; others are its dependencies and usually can be deleted from the script.
- In other scripts you can use the same .NET assembly (don't need to convert again). Either copy-paste the `/*/ com Shell32 ...; /*/`, or in the **Properties** dialog click the **...** button and select from submenu **Use converted**. Or convert again, it does not harm.
- COM is an old technology. Some downloaded COM components may be 32-bit only. Script processes are 64-bit by default and can't use 32-bit dlls. To use 32-bit dlls, in the **Properties** dialog select role `exeProgram` and check **bit32**.
